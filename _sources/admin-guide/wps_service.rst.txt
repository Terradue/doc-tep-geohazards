WPS services management
=======================

| The WPS services management page contains a list of all existing WPS services in DB, with the possibility for an Administrator to *Create* a new WPS service, *Update* or *Delete* an existing one.
| When updating it, it is possible to set the Availability to "true" or "false" to make the service visible or not.
| The Administrator can also *Manage* groups that can see each WPS provider (by clicking on |manage|). This will allow him to define if the WPS service is public (visible for all), private (visible only by the owner and administrators) or restricted only to a list of groups.

| To add a group, click on |plus| in front of the group's name in the *All Groups* panel.
| To remove a group, click on |minus| in front of the group's name in the *Allowed Groups* panel.
