Groups management
=================

| The groups management page contains a list of all existing groups, with the possibility for an Administrator to *Create* a new group, *Update* or *Delete* an existing one.
| The Administrator can also *Manage* users of a group (by clicking on |manage|). This will allow him to add/remove users into/from a group.

| To add a user in the group, click on |plus| in front of the user's name in the *All Users* panel.
| To remove a user from the group, click on |minus| in front of the user's name in the *Members* panel.
