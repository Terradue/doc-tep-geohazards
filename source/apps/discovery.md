Thematic apps can be searched using filters defined by the user, such as:

> - **Free text**: search within title and description of the thematic app

The search is performed amongst thematic apps which are accessible to the current user.

All users also have an application dedicated to the management of their data (see {ref}`mydata_app`).

From the discovery page, users can also create their own *Thematic App* (see {ref}`myapp`).
