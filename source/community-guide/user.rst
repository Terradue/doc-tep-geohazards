Once registered on ESA EO Single Sign On (EO-SSO), you can simply sign-in using your EO-SSO credentials (username and password), and you will be automatically signed-in and redirected to the Geohazards TEP portal.
At the first access, you may be asked to check your inbox in order to confirm your email address (cf. message banner "Pending activation!").
