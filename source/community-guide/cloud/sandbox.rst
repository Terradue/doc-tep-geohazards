Developer Cloud Sandbox
=======================

The Developer Cloud Sandbox is a Virtual Machine (VM) that provides scientific developers with an Exploitation Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). It consists of a development environment for processor integration and testing, and a framework for Cloud provisioning.
The Developer Cloud Sandbox PaaS allows you to plug scientific applications written in a variety of languages (e.g. Java, C++, IDL, Python, R), then deploy, automate, manage and scale them in a very modular way. The algorithm integration is performed from within a dedicated Virtual Machine, running initially as a simulation environment (sandbox mode) that can readily scale to production (cluster mode). Accessed from an harmonized Shell environment, support tools also facilitate the data access and workflow management tasks.

The `Getting Started Guide <http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/start/index.html>`_ will drive you step by step through the use of your Sandbox from access to a Laboratory to the Sandbox remote use.

- Access the Cloud Dashboard (see :ref:`dashboard`)
- Click on |plus.png| to create a new Developer Cloud Sandbox
- Type the Developer Cloud Sandbox name
- Select the **Developer Cloud Sandbox** template

Access a Developer Cloud Sandbox
--------------------------------

To connect your Developer Cloud Sandbox you need a secure connection with the Terradue's infrastructure. Following this guide you will be able to access your Sandbox through the Secure Shell (SSH) network protocol.

.. WARNING::
  The VNC access to a "Developer Cloud Sandbox" virtual machine is intended only for the administrator usage. Regular users can access via the Secure Shell (SSH) only, as described in this section.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You have the <sandbox ip> value,
- You are connected to the GEP Laboratory (see :ref:`laboratory`),
- You installed your SSH key pair (see `Generate and install the SSH key pair <http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/start/laboratory/index.html#generate-and-install-the-ssh-key-pair>`)

- Open a Terminal,

- Type:

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh <cloud_username>@<sandbox host>

That's all :-)

- Open a Command Prompt,
- Change directory to the putty unzipped folder:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd \path\to\your\putty\folder
  
- Type:

.. code-block:: bash

  PUTTY.EXE -i id_rsa.ppk <cloud_username>@<sandbox_host>

That's all :-)
