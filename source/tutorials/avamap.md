## 1. Introduction

**AVAMAP** is a tool for mapping snow avalanches from Sentinel-1 data. The tool has been developed by the Norwegian Research Center - NORCE AS. It is based on change detection between pairs of repeat-pass SAR aquisitions \[1\].

## 2. Running AVAMAP

### 2.1 Select the Processing Service

- Sign-in on the GEP portal: <https://geohazards-tep.eu/>
- Access the Thematic App containing the **AVAMAP** service.
- Open the tab *Processing services* from the right of the map and select the processing service **AVAMAP**.

### 2.2 Visualize preprocessed masks

The detection algorithm is restricted by a set of masks, including:
\* **Radar mask**: indicating lack of data due to radar shadow and layover (one mask for each relative orbit of Sentinel-1)
\* **Runout mask**: indicating avalanche runout zones based on the local topography
\* **Land mask**: Indicate land (vs ocean)

The detection algorithm will only detect snow avalanches where these three masks are non-zero. The masks has been prepared on the GEP plarform, and can be visualized by selecting *Masks* on the top pane:

The masks are prepared in terms of tiles, which appear as bounding boxes on the map: Select a tile and click *Show details*, followed by *Show results* at the bottom left to visualize the masks:

Here, for instance, is the avalanche runout mask highlighted. White areas indicate where avalanches can potentially be found given the local topography:

### 2.3 User inputs

Apart from a **Job title**, the tool only requires three inputs from the user:
\* **Start date**: ISO8601-formatted time (UTC)
\* **End date**: ISO8601-formatted time (UTC)
\* **Area of interest**: Polygon as WKT-string

The **Area of interest** must be a polygon, and inputted either as a WKT, or can be imported from a polygon drawn on the map:

:::

To run the job, simply click *Run Job*.

:::{NOTE}
Since the revisit time of the Sentinel-1 satellites is typically 6-12 days, the time separation between **Start date** and **End date** should be at least this long in order include pairs of repeat-pass aquisitions.
:::

:::{NOTE}
Depending on the size of your area of interst, the time separation between start and end date, and processing capability of the GEP platform, the processing can take several hours.

### 2.4 Visualize results

Open the finished job, and click *Show results* on the Results pane to show the results. The results consists:

- **Detections**: Formatted as GeoJSON files, each containing a single detection as a polygon
- **RGB composites**: Constructed by a repeat-pass image pair, highlighting where the co-polarised backscatter has increased (green) or decreased (purple).

Here, results are shown for Lavangsdalen in Northern Norway

:::{NOTE}
Lavangsdalen is particlulary sensitive to snow avalanches since the main road to the city of Troms√∏ goes through the valley.

:::{NOTE}
The file naming convention for detections is: avaldet\_\[GRID_ID\]\_\[RELATIVE_ORBIT_NUMBER\]\_\[DATE_FIRST_PASS\]\_\[DATE_SECOND_PASS\]\_\[IMAGE_COUNT\]\_\[TOTAL_COUNT\].geojson

:::{NOTE}
The file naming convention for detections is: rgb\_\[GRID_ID\]\_\[RELATIVE_ORBIT_NUMBER\]\_\[DATE_FIRST_PASS\]\_\[DATE_SECOND_PASS\].geojson
