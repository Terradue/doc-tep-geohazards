This tutorial will describe the processing of a set of Sentinel-1 IW (or ASAR) images to generate a set of differential interferograms (IFG mode) or a mean displacement velocity map (MTA mode) on the GEP.

.. NOTE:: Processing parameters example for reproducing a succesful job are described in the end of this tutorial.

Processor configuration
=======================

The user shall login on the GEP to the EO services provided by TRE ALTAMIRA and in the Processing Services section, select the FASTVEL service.

First step consists in selecting the area of interest and the stack of images covering it to be processed. To do so:

* Select the data collection to be addressed in the EO Data button (InSAR Search, Sentinel-1, ERS, ENVISAT).
* Select the area on the map by using the polygon or square buttons. In the "Search Form" (loupe button) a temporal selection and specification about other search parameters can be done. The images must have the same "Orbit Direction" and the same track. It is important to select those images who present a significant degree of frame overlapping being sure that the AOI is fully covered by all of them.
* Choose the set of images to be processed on the "Current search result" section. **A minimum number of 25 images are required in MTA mode**. The selected list of images can be drop to the "Feature Basket" section and be saved as a "Data Package". This option is recommended in order to avoid performing the same image search again.

Complete the following list of processing parameters:

**Job title**: Job name as it will be labelled an it will appear in the Job list.

**SAR data set**: set of SLC images to be processed. A minimum number of 25 images are required. **Drag 
and drop the selected images on the search result (or in the "Feature Basket" section once the Data Package is loaded) to this field**. Note that depending on: the Maximum Temporal Baseline [days], the Maximum Perpendicular Baseline [m], the Maximum Doppler Difference [Hz] and the Maximum Doppler Centroid [Hz], this number could be reduced by the service causing the stop of the processing. To that matter it is recommended to put a number of images larger than 25. In the same way, at least to do initial tests, it is recommended to keep the images temporal sampling equal or grater than 12 days (ex: 24 days).

**Processing Mode**:

* **IFG**: generation of a set of differential interferograms. If this mode is selected, the parameters to be considered are: Area Of Interest, Maximum Temporal Baseline [days], Maximum Perpendicular Baseline [m], Maximum Doppler Difference [Hz], Maximum Doppler Centroid [Hz], Goldstein phase filter exponential factor, Phase Unwrapping.

* **MTA**: generation of the displacement velocity and updated topography maps. If this mode is selected, the parameters to be considered are: Area Of Interest, Reference Point Latitude [deg], Reference Point Longitude [deg], Maximum Temporal Baseline [days], Maximum Perpendicular Baseline [m], Maximum Doppler Difference [Hz], Maximum Doppler Centroid [Hz], Coherence Threshold, APS Correlation Distance [m].

**Area Of Interest**: definition of the results area. The polygon on the map can be imported as AOI. 
It can be also specified by [minlon, minlat, maxlon, maxlat]. *Example: 1.717,41.778,1.916,41.878*

**Reference Point Latitude [deg]**: (MTA mode) Latitude of the point (zero motion) to whom reference the velocity map points values. It has to be inside the AOI. An automatic check is done. *Example: 41.830858*

**Reference Point Longitude [deg]**: (MTA mode) Longitude of the point (zero motion) to whom reference the velocity map points values. It has to be inside the AOI. An automatic check is done. *Example: 1.753163*

**Maximum Temporal Baseline [days]**: (IFG and MTA mode) Maximum Temporal Baseline in days between images to allow the corresponding interferogram generation. *Default value: 365.*

**Maximum Perpendicular Baseline [m]**: (IFG and MTA mode) Maximum Spatial Baseline in meters between images to allow the corresponding interferogram generation. *Default value: 400.*

**Maximum Doppler Difference [Hz]**: (IFG and MTA mode) Maximum Doppler Centroid differences in Herzts between images to allow the corresponding interferogram generation. 
*Default value: 1000.*

**Maximum Doppler Centroid [Hz]**: (IFG and MTA mode) Maximum Image Doppler Centroid in Herzts for considering that image to be part of the dataset to process. *Default value: 2000.*

**Goldstein phase filter exponential factor**: (IFG mode) filter power factor [0,1]. *Default value: 0.5*

**Phase Unwrapping**: (IFG mode) selection of the phase unwrapping of the differential interferograms. *Default mode: false.*

**Coherence Threshold**: (MTA mode) mean interferometric coherence threshold for considering a pixel to be processed in the 
generation of the velocity and corrected topography maps. *Default value: 0.5.*

**APS Correlation Distance [m]**: (MTA mode) Atmospheric Phase Screen Correlation distance, i.e., 
maximum distance in meters allowed for connecting neighboring pixels in the process to generate the velocity and DEM error maps. *Default value: 3000.*


Running the job
===============

Click on "Run Job" button from the processor configuration panel. After that the processing status of the job is displayed along with its parameters. Wait for the job to complete. The job can be
accessed from the "Jobs" area presenting the processing percentage. When it succesfully ends it will present a green "success" status.
