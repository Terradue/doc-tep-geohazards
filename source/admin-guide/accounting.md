# Accounting

The accounting page gives to the administrator the credit balance, as well as the list of all transactions associated to a user account. Once the user selected, the following information are available:

- current user balance
- credit transactions
- debit transactions reported by wps providers for the wps jobs created by the user
- deposit transactions (see {ref}`deposit`)
