# Groups management

The groups management page contains a list of all existing groups, with the possibility for an Administrator to 

*Create*

 a new group, 

*Update*

 or 

*Delete*

 an existing one.

The Administrator can also 

*Manage*

 users of a group (by clicking on 

{{ manage }}

). This will allow him to add/remove users into/from a group.

To add a user in the group, click on 

{{ plus }}

 in front of the user's name in the 

*All Users*

 panel.

To remove a user from the group, click on 

{{ minus }}

 in front of the user's name in the 

*Members*

 panel.
