# WPS jobs management

The Wps Job management page gives to the administrator to the list of all wps jobs created on the platform.
The administrator can also for a choosen job get a detailed view with the possibility to copy the job to his list of jobs (as he created it himself). This is useful for example to test the output results of the job on the map when the job is not shared.
