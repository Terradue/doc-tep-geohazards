# Web story banners management

The Banners management page contains a list of all existing Banners, with a thumbnail of the image and its order within the carousel.

The Administrator is able to 

*Create*

 a new Banner, 

*Update*

 or 

*Delete*

 an existing one.

The ordering is done by simply moving the banner item in the list (up or down).
