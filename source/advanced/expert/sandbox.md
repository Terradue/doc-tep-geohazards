# Start working with Developer Cloud Sandbox

The Developer Cloud Sandbox is a Virtual Machine (VM) that provides scientific developers with an Exploitation Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). It consists of a development environment for processor integration and testing, and a framework for Cloud provisioning.
The Developer Cloud Sandbox PaaS allows you to plug scientific applications written in a variety of languages (e.g. Java, C++, IDL, Python, R), then deploy, automate, manage and scale them in a very modular way. The algorithm integration is performed from within a dedicated Virtual Machine, running initially as a simulation environment (sandbox mode) that can readily scale to production (cluster mode). Accessed from an harmonized Shell environment, support tools also facilitate the data access and workflow management tasks.

The [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/start/index.html) will drive you step by step through the use of your Sandbox from access to a Laboratory to the Sandbox remote use.

## Create a Developer Cloud Sandbox

:::{warning}
Be sure to have perfomed the previous steps of this guide to provision properly your sandbox.
:::

To create your own Developer Cloud Toolbox:

- Access the Cloud Dashboard at [https://cloud.terradue.com](https://cloud.terradue.com).\`
- Click on {{ plus.png }} to create a new Developer Cloud Sandbox
- Type the Developer Cloud Sandbox name
- Select the **Developer Cloud Sandbox** template

## Integrate your processor

For this part, you will use the [Developer Cloud Sandbox’s documentation](http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/).
We encourage you to follow the different guides, especially the **Getting Started Guide** and the **Developer’s Quick start** of this documentation to have a comprehensive understanding of the development environement

:::{note}
Please discard the prerequisites listed in the [Developer Cloud Sandbox’s documentation](http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/). If you achieved the previous steps of this guide sucessfully, you have all the elements to move forwrd with your sandbox and you processor integration.
