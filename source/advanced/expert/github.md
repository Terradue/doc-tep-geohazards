# Request your code repository

Your integrated processor code will live in a GitHub repository. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. The platform offers you both private repositories for limited access projects, and public repositories for open source projects.

## Geohazards TEP and the GitHub organization

The Geohazards TEP has a one-to-one relationship with the corresponding Geohazards TEP GitHub organization <https://github.com/geohazards-tep/>.

## Organizing the GitHub repository

As an expert user in the Geohazards TEP platforms, you must request a repository for storing your processor code. If you do not have it yet, you can request it from <https://support.terradue.com> (login with your credentials).
This is your collaborative workspace, where you can issue tickets to interact with the Operations Support team at Terradue.
