# Link your account to the Terradue Cloud Platform

To access the Cloud resources and login to the Cloud dashboard to create your first Sandbox, you need to have an account on the Terradue Cloud Platform.
As soon as your user is updated to become an Expert, an account is automatically created for you to the Terradue Cloud platform.

From your profile page in the portal, under the Application scenarios tab, you can check that you have a valid account, or create a new one.

:::{NOTE}
If you want to create an account with a different username or email, you can do it directly at <https://www.terradue.com/signup> (but a least one of Username or email shall be the same as in EO-SSO).

## Already have a Terradue account ?

If you already have an account on the Terradue Cloud Platform, the portal will be able to detect it by itself and display the Opennebula Sunstone logo.
If not the case, it means that you have a different username/email than on your EO-SSO profile. In this case, please contact us so we can manually link your accounts.
