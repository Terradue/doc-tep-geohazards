Request your code repository
----------------------------

Your integrated processor code will live in a GitHub repository. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. The platform offers you both private repositories for limited access projects, and public repositories for open source projects.

Organizing the GitHub repository
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As an expert user in the Geohazards TEP platforms, you must request a repository for storing your processor code. If you do not have it yet, you can request it from https://support.terradue.com (login with your credentials).
This is your collaborative workspace, where you can issue tickets to interact with the Operations Support team at Terradue.
