# Purpose of the Geohazards Thematic Exploitation Platform

The Geohazards Exploitation Platform or GEP aims to support the exploitation of satellite EO for geohazards. It follows the Supersites Exploitation Platform (SSEP), originally initiated in the context of the Geohazard Supersites & Natural Laboratories initiative (GSNL).

The geohazards platform has been expanded to address broader objectives of the geohazards community. In particular it is a contribution to the CEOS WG Disasters to support its Seismic Hazards Pilot and terrain deformation applications of its Volcano Pilot.

The geohazards platform and SSEP are sourced with elements – data, tools, and processing including INSAR – relevant to the Geohazards theme and related exploitation scenarios.
