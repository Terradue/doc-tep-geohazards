# A data processing facility

The portal is powered by a data processing facility, and by a number of Geobrowser apps addressing thematic activities.

The data processing facility is where authorised partners can **deploy** processing services, for the Portal users to **process** data, or access and **reproduce** past processing jobs.

The **data sources** available inside a Geobrowser App are accessed from the {doc}`Data Contexts menu <../community-guide/platform/geobrowser>`.

The **data services** available inside a Geobrowser App are accessed from the {doc}`Data services tab <../community-guide/platform/geobrowser>`.

The **processing services** available inside a Geobrowser App are accessed from the {doc}`Processing services tab <../community-guide/platform/geobrowser>`.

The **processing jobs** created by or shared with a user are also accessed from the {doc}`Processing services tab <../community-guide/platform/geobrowser>`.
